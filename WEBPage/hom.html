				<h2>Everything you should know about corona virus...</h2>
				<p id="home" style="font-family:system-ui;font-size:18px;  ">A novel strain of coronavirus — SARS-CoV-2 — was first detected in December 2019 in Wuhan, a city in China’s Hubei province with a population of 11 million, after an outbreak of pneumonia without an obvious cause. The virus has now spread to over 200 countries and territories across the globe, and was characterised as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020[1],[2].
					As of 3 November 2020, there were 46,591,622 laboratory-confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection globally, with 1,201,200 reported deaths. The number of cases and deaths outside of China overtook those within the country on 16 March 2020[3]. 
As of  2 November 2020, there have been 1,053,864 confirmed cases of the virus in the UK and 58,925 of these have died (in all settings, within 28 days of the test). </p>
<h2>Why are they called coronaviruses?</h2>
<p id="home"; style="font-family:system-ui;font-size:18px;  "> As the journal Nature reported in 1968, “these viruses are members of a previously unrecognized group which [the virologists] suggest should be called the coronaviruses, to recall the characteristic appearance by which these viruses are identified in the electron microscope.”

The word “corona” has many different meanings (see Appendix 2). But it was the sun that the virologists had in mind when they chose the name coronaviruses. As they wrote, they compared “the characteristic ‘fringe’ of projections” on the outside of the virus with the solar corona (not, as some have suggested, the points on a crown).Figure 1 illustrates this
